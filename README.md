# Backend-Programming

## Overview

This repository focuses on backend web development using Node.js and Express.js. It follows the MVC architecture and emphasizes best practices for building secure, well-structured RESTful APIs. Key components such as authentication with JWT, API testing with Postman, documentation with Swagger, and integration with MongoDB using Mongoose are included to provide a complete backend development experience.

## Topics Covered

### Express.js & MVC Architecture

- **Express.js**: Lightweight and fast web framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Organizing code into models, controllers, and routes to promote separation of concerns and scalability.

### REST API Development

- **RESTful Routing**: Creating standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for handling client-server interactions.
- **Middleware Usage**: Implementing custom and built-in middleware for request processing and error handling.

### Authentication & Security

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Implementing stateless authentication by generating, signing, and validating tokens for secured routes and user sessions.

### Logging & Monitoring

- **Logger Integration**: Setting up logging systems to track server activity, error logs, and request flows for better monitoring and debugging.

### Database Integration

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing schema definitions, model-based queries, and data validation.

### Node.js Best Practices

- **Code Hygiene**: Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code with proper structure and formatting.
- **Commenting**: Using meaningful comments to improve code readability and documentation for developers.

### API Testing & Documentation

- **Postman**: Testing REST APIs with different HTTP methods, payloads, authentication tokens, and headers to ensure reliability.
- **Swagger**: Generating interactive and up-to-date API documentation to describe endpoints, request/response schemas, and available operations.
